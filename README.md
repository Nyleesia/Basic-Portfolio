<h1>Basic-Portfolio</h2>
<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>This repository contains a basic portfolio which I built to specifications during my third week 
learning web development at the Georgia Tech full stack web development bootcamp. </p>
<p>Although the course goes at a very fast pace, the results are undeniable. I have been 
enjoying every grueling moment of it. It is also giving me many opportunities to practice 
paying attention to details, which I love. </p>
